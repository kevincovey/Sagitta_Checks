### Sagitta Inputs+outputs for catalogs with distance shifted copies: ###

- Catalog of likely members of young (ages 30-300 Myr) open clusters
    (from
[Meingast, Alves & Rottensteiner 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...645A..84M/abstract),
via
[Vizier](https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/A+A/645/A84)
and TOPCAT to match to Gaia + 2MASS)

    Distance Filtering: catalog synthetically shifted to distances between
10-500pc, in steps of 30 pc (original locations also retained,
including many > 500pc)
